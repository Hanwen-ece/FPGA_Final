# Performance Comparison: CPU vs GPU
# ======================================

## Test Configuration
Image size: 3840x2160 (8.29 MP)
Iterations: 1000
GPU Kernel: Local Memory (optimized)

## Execution Time
CPU (measured): 6712.563 ms (6.713 seconds) - System load detected
CPU (baseline): 372.030 ms (0.372 seconds) - Used for speedup calculation
GPU: 211.772 ms (0.212 seconds)

## Performance Metrics
Speedup: 1.76x
GPU is 1.76x faster than CPU
Time reduction: 160.258 ms (43.1% improvement)
GPU Throughput: 39166.66 MPixels/s

## Note
The measured CPU time (6712.563 ms) was affected by system load.
Speedup calculation uses baseline CPU time (372.030 ms) for accurate comparison.

## Summary
The GPU implementation achieves a 1.76x speedup over the CPU implementation.
This represents a 43.1% performance improvement.
